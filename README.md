 the matlab script present in this repository processes the following data tables generated by the aerodynamic analysis program xflr5 and elaborates the data to visualize the effects of the arrow angle variations on the main aerodynamic coefficients. Furthermore, a classification of the configurations that best optimize the coefficients is drawn up
